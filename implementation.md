## 2. Core Features Implementation

### Authentication System
1. **Member Verification**
   - Store member records with phone numbers in `members.json`
   - Create login endpoint to verify membership number/phone
   - Implement OTP generation and verification
   
2. **Session Management**
   - Create session tokens after successful verification
   - Store active sessions in `sessions.json`
   - Implement session expiration for security

### Voting System
1. **Ballot Creation**
   - Store election positions in `positions.json`
   - Store candidates in `candidates.json` with position references
   - Generate dynamic ballot based on active positions

2. **Vote Recording**
   - Create secure endpoints for submitting votes
   - Validate that member hasn't already voted
   - Store votes anonymously in `votes.json`
   - Implement vote confirmation mechanism

### Admin Dashboard
1. **Results Display**
   - Create real-time vote counting mechanism
   - Implement visualization for vote statistics
   - Ensure vote anonymity in the display

2. **Management Functions**
   - Create interfaces for managing positions
   - Create interfaces for managing candidates
   - Implement system settings and controls

## 3. Security Measures

1. **Data Protection**
   - Hash member IDs in vote records to ensure anonymity
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
   - Add CSRF protection for form submissions

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based authorization for admin functions
   - Create secure middleware for protected routes
   - Add IP-based restrictions for admin access (optional)

3. **System Integrity**
   - Add vote validation to prevent duplicate voting
   - Implement audit logging for system events
   - Create regular file backups to prevent data loss

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure (Week 1)
1. Initialize Node.js project
2. Set up Express application
3. Create basic file structure and data models
4. Implement file-based database operations

### Phase 2: Authentication System (Week 1-2)
1. Implement member verification logic
2. Set up Twilio integration for SMS OTP
3. Create session management
4. Build login and verification interfaces

### Phase 3: Voting Functionality (Week 2-3)
1. Implement election position and candidate management
2. Create voting interface and logic
3. Implement vote recording and validation

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Week 3-4)
1. Create admin authentication
2. Build results dashboard with real-time updates
3. Implement position and candidate management
4. Add system settings and controls

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (Week 4)

_______________________________
Next Steps in Implementation
Based on the current state of your secure online voting system, here are the next key steps to focus on:
1. Complete the Data Models Structure

Create the initial data files structure in the data directory
Set up sample data for testing (members, positions, candidates)
Ensure the file permissions are properly set for the data directory

2. Test Authentication Flow

Test the OTP generation and verification process
Validate session management functionality
Verify admin authentication works correctly

3. Implement the Voting Interface

Test the ballot generation to ensure positions and candidates display properly
Verify vote submission works and properly records votes
Implement vote confirmation and receipt generation

4. Develop Admin Dashboard Functionality

Complete results tabulation and display
Implement election management features (start/stop election)
Test candidate and position management functions

5. Security Enhancements

Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
Add proper CSRF protection for all forms
Ensure vote anonymity in results display

6. System Testing

Test the end-to-end voting process
Verify eligibility checks work correctly
Test edge cases (session timeout, invalid OTPs)

7. Setup for Deployment

Prepare environment variables for Glitch
Ensure file paths are correctly configured for deployment
Create documentation for system setup and administration

8. User Interface Refinements

Enhance responsive design for mobile devices
Improve accessibility features
Add loading indicators and user feedback
