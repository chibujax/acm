Just to give us insight on my plan. We are creating an online voting system to make the election process secure, easy, and accessible. Eligible voting Members will verify their identity with their phone numbers before they can vote, ensuring that only eligible people can participate. ⸻ Step-by-Step Process : 1. Login/Verification: • Members will go to the voting website. • They will enter their membership number (or phone number). • To confirm they are the real owners of the numbers , the system will send them a code (OTP) to their phone. • They will enter the code to be verified. 2. Voting: • Once verified, they will see the election categories (like President, Secretary, etc.). • Under each category, the nominees’ names and photos will be displayed. • They will click to select their choice in each category. 3. Submit Vote: • After making all their selections, they will click Submit. • Their vote will be securely recorded in the system. 4. Live Results: • The votes will update a live dashboard so authorized personnel (election committee) can see the results as they come in (without showing who voted for who — it remains anonymous). This means there will be admin page(dashboard) to see the result, to add elective positions, to add nominees, and any other setting

Can you generate  implementation plan for this project(using node), something that can run on glitch, (node 16) and using file system(text) as database for now
